# INTRODUCTION
The Internet of things is defined as the inter-networking of physical Devices such as traffic lights, homes accessories, Industrial equipment, automobile or embedded items like sensors, actuators, software and create a system which enable the different object to collect, exchange or preform analytics over data that is connected to network. The IOT is the future of technology where the physical objects can be connected through internet and also recognize themselves to the other devices. The internet of things is based on the sensor technology, RFID,Wireless technologies, where the internet is the main medium to control and connect the devices as well as human interaction with the machines . As we all know that natural calamities are uncontrollable like floods, tornado, earthquake etc. but by the mean of technology we can control their devastated effects. Isn’t it fascinating we know before the flood and save our self’s and important utensils before it happens. This project “flood prevention system” basically a basic structure which identify the rise in the water level during the heavy raining outside and notify via email or message alert through network, So that the person have time to secure there utensils and prepare themselves before it happen. Although the use is not limited to this we can use this system anywhere where we have to deal with the water or any liquid level notification.

ALGORITHM: -

	STEP1: - If the rainfall occurred 

	STEP2: - Sensor get activated, monitoring water level initiated  

	STEP3: - loop initiated 

	STEP4: - Analysing of new water level and send data for calculation.

	STEP5: - if the water level is above the prescribed level then

	STEP6: - Evaluating the threshold value and send the notification about flooding condition.

	STEP7: - Warning notification send via Wi-Fi network.

	STEP8: - Stop the System.
